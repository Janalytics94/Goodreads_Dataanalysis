# Goodreads_Datanalysis
This project was created as part of a term paper for the module Data Analysis 1 at the Humboldt University. The data set Goodreads.csv is analysed exploratively and a K-Means cluster analysis is performed.
The Goodreads-books data set is available on the platform www.kaggle.com and was created on May 25, 2019 using the API https://www.goodreads.com/api of the Website https://www.goodreads.com.
Goodreads is a social cataloging platform, that allows users to search freely its database of books, annotations and reviews. Individuals can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists as well as create their own groups of book suggestions, surveys, blogs, polls and discussions.
To have more scope during the analysis of the data set, additional information of the books
like the price and the genre was gathered.
The genre data was added manually while the price data was scrapped from the website https://isbndb.com.

2. In the branch book_price_crawler the original book-2.csv data set is complemented by the price in $ and the goodreads.csv dataset is generated. The genre data was added manually
